    description:
      "Dress professionally and appropriately for the company culture. First impressions count, so keep it clean, simple, and confident.",
    content: `
       Your interview outfit speaks volumes before you even say a word. For corporate environments, opt for a tailored suit in neutral colors. Business casual settings allow for dress pants with a blazer or a conservative dress. Creative fields might welcome more personality, but still maintain professionalism.</p>
       Key elements to consider:</p>
       
         Ensure clothes are clean, pressed, and well-fitting 
         Limit accessories and avoid strong perfumes/colognes 
         Choose comfortable, polished shoes 
         Grooming should be impeccable - neat hair, clean nails 
      
       When in doubt, it's better to be slightly overdressed than underdressed. Research the company's dress code beforehand by checking their website or social media.</p>
